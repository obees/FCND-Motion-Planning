# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.
> lat0 and lon0 are on the first line of the colliders.csv file. The line looks like this
```
lat0 37.792480, lon0 -122.397450
```
> To extract float lat0 and lon0
- Open file colliders.csv
- Read first line
- Remove end of line
- split by ',' to seperate lat0 and lon0
- suppress potential blank at the beginning of lat0 or lon0 string
- Split by ' ' lat0 and lon0 to separate label and values
- Select indice [1] to get values
- Cast to float values
- use self.set_home_position() method to set global home
```
with open('colliders.csv') as f:
        [lat0,lon0] = [float(a.lstrip(' ').split(' ')[1]) for a in f.readline().rstrip('\n').split(',')]

self.set_home_position(lon0, lat0, 0)
```

#### 2. Set your current local position
Here as long as you successfully determine your local position relative to global home you'll be all set. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.

- Global position is constructed from Drone class members for longitude, latitude and altitude
- Once global_position is set you get local position by using the utility method global_to_local()
```
global_position = (self._longitude, self._latitude, self._altitude)
current_local_pos = global_to_local(global_position, self.global_home)

```

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!
- the graph shares the coordinate system with the obstacles so no translation needed
```
grid_start = (int(current_local_pos[0]),int(current_local_pos[1]),int(current_local_pos[2]))
```
#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.
> The code below  allows to convert from geodetic coords (GPS) to local coords
```
grid_goal_global = (-122.398921, 37.797879, -20)
grid_goal_to_local = global_to_local(grid_goal_global, self.global_home)
grid_goal = (int(grid_goal_to_local[0]),int(grid_goal_to_local[1]),int(grid_goal_to_local[2]))
```

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.
> A* adapted for graph is used here, the motion cost is calculated via heuristic since it fits measuring the distance between nodes of an edge. It's in the weight attribute of the added edge
```
def create_graph(self,nodes, k, polygons):
      g = nx.Graph()
      tree = KDTree(nodes)
      for n1 in nodes:
          # for each node connect try to connect to k nearest nodes
          idxs = tree.query([n1], k, return_distance=False)[0]

          for idx in idxs:
              n2 = nodes[idx]
              if n2 == n1:
                  continue

              if self.can_connect(n1, n2, polygons):
                  heuristic_val = heuristic(n1,n2)
                  g.add_edge(n1, n2, weight=heuristic_val)
      return g

def heuristic(position, goal_position):
    return np.linalg.norm(np.array(position) - np.array(goal_position))
```

#### 6. Cull waypoints
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.
> To prune the path, the polygons methods are used to check is two node can connect. Relying on this information a pruning mechanism verifying every nodes pair is used
```
def prune_path(self, path, polygons):

      pruned_path = [p for p in path]
      # TODO: prune the path!

      i = 0
      while i < len(pruned_path)-2:
          p1 = pruned_path[i]
          j=i+2
          connected_j = 0
          while j < len(pruned_path):
              p3 = pruned_path[j]
              if self.can_connect(p1, p3, polygons):
                  connected_j = j
              j = j + 1
          if connected_j > 0:
              for k in range(i+1, connected_j):
                  pruned_path.remove(pruned_path[i+1])
          i = i + 1

      return pruned_path

def can_connect(self,n1, n2, polygons):
      l = LineString([n1, n2])
      for p in polygons:
          if p.crosses(l) and p.height >= min(n1[2], n2[2]):
              return False
      return True
```

# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
